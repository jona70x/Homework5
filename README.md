## Question 1) Define the following unit, integration, regression tests and when you would use each?
- Unit Test: Tests that verify the functionality of small blocks of code or components that make up a bigger block of code. I would use it to test functions or classes right after I creat them. 
- Integration Test: They test how well code blocks or components work with other units. I would use these tests if I create different classes that need to interact with each other. Also, I'd use them if I install a framework and I need to make sure that works well with my components. 
- Regression Test: These are testss that make sure that there is still compatibility with previous code. Basically, they test that the new changes still work with the previous units and do not break anything. I'd use them if I implement a patch or update an existing framework that is used in my code and I want to make that everything still works.
